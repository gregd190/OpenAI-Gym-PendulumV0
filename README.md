# OpenAI-Gym-PendulumV0
A neural network solution to the OpenAI Gym Pendulum-V0 environment

# Trains over ~1000 episodes, plays 10 iterations and plots the reward vs number of iterations
# There is surely room for hyperparameter optimization, but it trains in minutes on a CPU and performs well as is. 
# By default loads pre-trained weights, but code for training has been left in but is commented out.
